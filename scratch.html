                    <li>CyberSecurity - Companies like Palo Alto Networks, Fortinet, and F5 ahve proven how great Cyber
                        Security companies can be. The government has great incentive to ensure that Cyber Security
                        companies continue to perform as it is a national threat as well.</li>
                    <li>CRM companies - CRM tools are essential for companies to survive and provide support for all of

                    <li>GPU manufacturers - These companies manufacture GPUs, which are Graphic Processing Units. They
                        are most used for Video Games and large Data Centers.</li>
                    <li>CPU manufacturers - These companies manufacture CPUs, which are Central Processing Units are
                        used for basic computing, analyzing big data, etc.</li>

            </li>
            <li>Consumer
                <ul>
                    <li>Retail companies - These companies will sell you clothes, or everyday items. They will be around
                        for a long time because everyone always needs stuff. Hard to find clear market leaders in this
                        space.</li>

                        rather than an item. Think TopGolf, Amusement Parks, Aquariums, Zoos, etc.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                        built out each project to value each project and the cash flows they would bring in, and then we
                        used a public company comparables to find out a value for the entire company.</li>
